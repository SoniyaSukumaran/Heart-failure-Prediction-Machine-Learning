# Heart-failure-Prediction-Machine-Learning
**Problem Statement**

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, demanding precise diagnostic techniques to optimise patient care and treatment planning. This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the survival of heart failure patients using clinical record data. Four distinct machine learning models are used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVC

The data set used for this project contains records of 299 heart failure patients with 13 features. It contains both binary and numerical features.
The features in the dataset are:
•	Anaemia 
•	High blood pressure
•	Diabetes
•	Sex
•	Smoking
•	Age 
•	Creatinine phosphokinase level in blood
•	Ejection fraction in percentage
•	Platelets count
•	Levels of serum creatinine
•	Serum sodium column with level of sodium in blood
